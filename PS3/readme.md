`lava.py` models the velocity profile of a viscous flow, in this case lava, down an inclined slope. The physical effects considered are the force of gravity and viscous dissipation. A no-slip condition is imposed at the bottom of the flow, and a no-stress condition is imposed at the top of the flow. The flow begins with zero velocity and is allowed to evolve over time. The steady-state solution to this problem, derived in class, is also plotted to show the asympotic behaviour of the time-depdendent flow.

The height, angle, and viscosity of the flow can be changed. The selected viscosity is 10^4cP, approximately the viscosity of a basaltic lava.
